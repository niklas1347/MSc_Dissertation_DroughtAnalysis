This repository shows the code used to plot the figures for the dissertation: "How Climate Change affects Droughts in South America â€“ Copula-Based Drought Analysis with an Event Attribution Case Study".

In order for the code to funciton properly it is important the structure of the directories is the same than in this repository. This is necessary the code build up on each other and values are stored and loaded in specified directories. This is done in order to do the analysis with the data as some of the calculations, for example of the SPEI values, need hours to days depending on the resolution of the model.
